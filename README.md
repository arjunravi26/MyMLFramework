#  ML Project Structure Creation
A Framework for ML project.

This project aims to provide a robust structure for deploying machine learning models using Flask and HTML.

## Project Structure

- **Flask and HTML**: Deploy your machine learning models seamlessly with our Flask and HTML integration.
- **Exception Handling**: Exception handling to ensure your application runs smoothly under all circumstances.
- **Logging Library**: Keep track of your application's activities with our integrated logging library.
- **Setup File**: Easy setup with our setup file. Get your application up and running in no time.
- **Index.html and app.py**: Basic files to kickstart your application.

Other predefined structure including essential files and folders:

- **requirements.txt**: An empty file for you to list your project dependencies.
- **README**: An empty README file for you to document your project.
- **src**: A source folder containing two subfolders:
  - **component**: An empty folder for you to add your project components.
  - **pipeline**: An empty folder for you to manage your data pipelines.
- **templates**: An empty templates folder for your HTML templates.
- **artifacts**: A dedicated folder to store data and pickle files.

## **Usage**
**Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started with the ML Framework Project:**

1. **Clone the Project**: First, you need to clone the project to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunravi26/MyMLFramework.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Location**: Navigate to the location where you want to create the folder for your machine learning project. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/desired/location
```
Replace `/path/to/your/desired/location` with the actual path on your local machine where you want to create the folder for your machine learning project.

3. **Run the Project**: Finally, you can run the project using the following command:
```bash
python location_of_cloned_project/MyMLFramework/main.py 'your_project_name'
```
Replace `location_of_cloned_project` with the actual location where you cloned the project.
Replace `your_project_name` with the actual project name.


This will create the necessary project structure at your desired location. You can then start adding your machine learning code and other necessary files.
