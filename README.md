#  ML Framework Project
A Framework for ML project.

This project aims to provide a robust structure for deploying machine learning models using Flask and HTML.

## Project Structure

- **Flask and HTML**: Deploy your machine learning models seamlessly with our Flask and HTML integration.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust exception handling to ensure your application runs smoothly under all circumstances.
- **Logging Library**: Keep track of your application's activities with our integrated logging library.
- **Setup File**: Easy setup with our setup file. Get your application up and running in no time.
- **Index.html and app.py**: Basic files to kickstart your application.

Other predefined structure including essential files and folders:

- **requirements.txt**: An empty file for you to list your project dependencies.
- **README**: An empty README file for you to document your project.
- **src**: A source folder containing two subfolders:
  - **component**: An empty folder for you to add your project components.
  - **pipeline**: An empty folder for you to manage your data pipelines.
- **templates**: An empty templates folder for your HTML templates.
- **artifacts**: A dedicated folder to store data and result models.

Thank you for your support and we look forward to seeing what you will build with our ML Framework Project!


**Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started with the ML Framework Project:**

1. **Clone the Project**: First, you need to clone the project to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLFrameworkProject.git
```
Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/MLFrameworkProject.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Desired Location**: Navigate to the location where you want to create the folder for your machine learning project. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/desired/location
```
Replace `/path/to/your/desired/location` with the actual path on your local machine.

3. **Run the Project**: Finally, you can run the project using the following command:
```bash
python location_of_cloned_project/MyMLFramework
```
Replace `location_of_cloned_project` with the actual location where you cloned the project.

This will create the necessary project structure at your desired location. You can then start adding your machine learning code and other necessary files.
